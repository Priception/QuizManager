# QuizManager

Project Overview and Objectives

You work for WebbiSkools Ltd, a software company that provides on-line educational
solutions for education establishments and training providers. Your manager would like you
to design, build, and test a database-driven website to manage quizzes, each consisting of a
set of multiple-choice questions and their associated answers. The websiteâ€™s capabilities will
only be accessible to known users. Users with full permissions will be able to view and edit
the questions and answers; users with lesser permissions will be able to view them but not
edit them; users with minimal permissions will only be able to see the questions.

You will need to:
1. Review all the key information and create a design for the quiz manager;
2. Construct the quiz manager in accordance with the design;
3. Test that the quiz manager meets its requirements;
4. Document what you built.
